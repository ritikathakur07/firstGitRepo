      Tim Bergling (8 September 1989 â€“ 20 April 2018),
      known professionally as Avicii, was a Swedish musician, DJ,
      remixer, and record producer. At 16, Bergling began posting his remixes
      on electronic music forums, which led to his first record deal.[3] He rose
      to prominence in 2011 with his single "Levels". His debut studio album,
      True (2013), blended electronic music with elements of multiple genres and
      received generally positive reviews. It peaked in the top ten in more than
      fifteen countries and topped international dance charts; the
      lead single, "Wake Me Up", topped most music markets in Europe and reached
      number four in the United States.
